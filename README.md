# JavaScript-Quiz
For this project we had to build a JavaScript multiple-choice quiz with a timer.  It had to have a way to reveal whether an answer was correct or wrong, a way for the user to input initials for a high score area, and an actual high score table.  We used local storage for our high scores.

This assignment was very challenging, but I learned a great deal about functions, timers, timeout functions, arrays, and ways to make the webpage dynamic by bringing in question content on clicks of the mouse.  I also learned how to use that local storage, and am becoming much better at using the console for identifying errors and helping to style and format.

I have a few screenshots and a short video in the assets folder, but here they are as well:
